        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I grew up programming and making small games, and slowly moved into QA and Cyber Security roles. Through this I collected knowledge on quite a few languages including - but not limited to - C#, C++, Python and Java. On a slightly less professional note, I enjoy listening to and producing music, playing games, and being in nature.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <div class="stss">
            <h3>See The Sun Set - Game - 2024 to 2025</h3>
            <p>See The Sun Set was a Virtual Reality game I was building from the ground up using Epic Games' "Unreal Engine 5". I was programming with a mix of Blueprints and C++. A combination of the project being out of my capabilities, and error, has resulted in this project being discontinued.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="squares">
            <h3>squares! - Game - 2023 to 2024</h3>
            <p>squares! was a 2D puzzle game I began developing late into 2023 and stopped in 2024. I was designing it using "Unity" but paused production temporarily when the pricing changes were announced. I would like to go back to this as a side project sometime in the near future.</p>

        <h2>What I've Done</h2>
        <div class="se5">
            <h3>Rebellion - Sniper Elite 4/5</h3>
            <p>While I never worked directly for Rebellion, I worked somewhat closely with their Level Designers on a few Game Engine related bugs, along with some other hyper-specific things. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/vuY0bQJ">Here</a> you can find the related images on said topic.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="warframe">
            <h3>Digital Extremes - Warframe</h3>
            <p>Almost the same story with DE (Digital Extremes), however I was never as close with the team. I figured out how to do some pretty game breaking bugs relatively easily, and naturally reported them. The relevant images are posted <a href="https://imgur.com/a/wRBoT5p">here</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="random">
            <h3>Miscellaneous - Web and Desktop Apps</h3>
            <p>One of my favourite passtimes is seeing how many menus I can open, or how badly I can break into an Application or Website using tools regularly at my disposal. Through this I have discovered a few bugs in various places scattered across the internet, and reported on them. As an example, on a cyber security blog, I used a technique they talked about to gain administrator access to the site.</p>

    <section id="school">
        <h2>Schooling</h2>
        <h2>Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology - 2025 to present</h2>
        <h3>Bachelors of Applied Computer Science</h3>
        <p>As far as I'm aware, I am the 2nd 16 year old to be doing a Bachelors in NZ, if not, at least in my school. I enjoy the python work we are doing but I would much rather spend my time working full time than in school. It is a nice change from the work we would do in high school.</p>
