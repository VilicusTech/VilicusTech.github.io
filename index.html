        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I grew up Programming and making small games, and slowly moved into QA and Cyber Security roles. Through this I collected knowledge on quite a few languages including - but not limited - C#, C++, Python and Java. On a slightly less professoional note, I enjoy listening to and producing music, playing games, and being in nature.</p>

            <h3>See The Sun Set - Game - 2024 to 2025</h3>
            <p>See The Sun Set was a Virtual Reality game I was building from the ground up using Epic Games' "Unreal Engine 5" programming with a mix of Blueprints and C++. During the development I had help from a few other developers, including funding, assests, and textures. I had gotten 9 months into development, deep into a few vital game systems when I forgot to backup or even transfer my files between PCs, losing all the work I had done.</p>

        <div class="squares">
            <h3>squares! - Game - 2023 to 2024</h3>
            <p>squares! was a 2D puzzle game I began developing late into 2023 and stopped in 2024. I was designing it using "Unity" but stopped when the pricing changes were announced. There isn't much else to this entry.</p>

        <h2>What I've Done</h2>
        <div class="se5">
            <h3>Rebellion - Sniper Elite 4/5</h3>
            <p>While I never worked directly for Rebellion, I worked closely with their Level Designers and QA Team on a few Physics related bugs, along with some other hyper-specific things. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/vuY0bQJ">Here</a> you can find the related images on said topic.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="warframe">
            <h3>Digital Extremes - Warframe</h3>
            <p>Almost the same story with DE (Digital Extremes), however I was never as close with the team. I figured out how to do some pretty game breaking bugs relatively easily, and naturally reported them. The relevant images are posted <a href="https://imgur.com/a/wRBoT5p">here</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="random">
            <h3>Miscellaneous - Web and Desktop Apps</h3>
            <p>One of my favourite passtimes is seeing how many menus I can open, or how badly I can break into an Application or Website using tools regularly at my disposal. Through this I have discovered a few bugs in various places scattered across the internet, and reported on them.</p>
