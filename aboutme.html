            <h1>About <span>Me<br></span></h1>
            <p>Hey! So this is the part where it gets slightly less professional and I have the opportunity to share a small part of my story with you.<br>
                <br>When I was young I got heavily into Programming and Game Development. From there I learnt C# and branched off into C++ and Python. I began writing small games and projects when I was about 11-12, and started working on HTML and Full-Stack Development a little later. A lot of my time has been spent inside Programming and Developing random Apps, and that has been my pass-time for the past 6 years of my life. I have Spec'd heavily into Cyber-Security, and by extension, Quality Assurance. Doing this, I have had opportunities to work along-side (but not with/for) some larger companies such as: Digital Extremes, Rebellion, and Riot Games (Check Experience for more).<br>
                <br>Now for a little bit more of a Personal About Me. Hey! My name is Lochlan, but sometimes I go by Alex. I'm young, but not too young to work, if you want details reach out and we can talk. As I mentioned in the paragraph above, I have spent a lot of my life Programming. From about 6-9 I was in a Programming club, where we focused on HTML, JS, and Python. For my hobbies, I participate in Youth Search and Rescue, playing games competitively, and camping. If I think of other things to add, I will.
